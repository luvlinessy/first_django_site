# django_site
I created this project using **Django 4 framework**, **SQLite3**, **Bootstrap 5**, **HTML and CSS**. 

### This project helped me a lot in learning the frontend, digging deeper into the framework, and understanding how databases work. 
This is a blog with interesting articles about food. 

Despite the fact that I am a backend developer, I had to write the **frontend**, which turned out to be very interesting, although difficult.
